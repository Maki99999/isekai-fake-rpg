# isekai-fake-rpg


I wanted to recreate a specific moment from a dream I once had in Unity.

I had a few really good ideas while doing so, so now I'm making a proper game out of it.
I think the main idea is pretty unique.


I think the playtime will be around 30 minutes (when doing no mistakes). 
Genres will be something like horror and rpg.
